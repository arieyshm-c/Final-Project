Our project focuses on developing a Building Management System (BMS) using IoT technologies to enhance energy efficiency, user safety, and environmental monitoring. The system integrates sensors like DHT-11 for temperature and humidity, PIR motion detectors for activity sensing, and an LCD for real-time data display. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi 3B+, the BMS manages fire alarms, energy consumption monitoring, and door/window states. The system communicates via GPIO for sensor interactions and Wi-Fi for external API integration using CIMIS for weather data.
